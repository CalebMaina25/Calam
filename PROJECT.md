# SupportAI - E-commerce Customer Support Automation

## 🎯 Problem Explanation

### The Challenge
E-commerce businesses face a critical bottleneck in customer support operations. A typical online store receives 200-500 support tickets daily covering:
- Order tracking inquiries ("Where is my package?")
- Return and refund requests
- Product-specific questions
- Payment and checkout issues
- Account management concerns

**The Cost of Manual Support:**
- Average response time: 4-24 hours
- Support agent cost: $15-25/hour
- Customer churn from slow responses: 15-30%
- Misrouted tickets waste 20-30% of agent time

### Why This Matters
In e-commerce, **response speed directly impacts revenue**. Studies show:
- 42% of customers expect responses within 1 hour
- 90% of customers rate immediate responses as important
- Fast support increases customer lifetime value by 25%

**Real-World Context:**
Small to medium e-commerce businesses (100-1000 orders/day) struggle to afford 24/7 support teams. They need intelligent automation that can instantly categorize, prioritize, and suggest responses to common inquiries while escalating complex issues to human agents.

## 💡 Solution

### How SupportAI Works
SupportAI leverages **Firebase Genkit** with Google's Gemini AI to create an intelligent support triage system that:

1. **Instantly categorizes** incoming tickets into predefined categories
2. **Analyzes sentiment** to detect frustrated or angry customers
3. **Assigns priority** based on urgency indicators and customer emotion
4. **Generates contextual responses** that agents can review and send

### AI Integration (Genkit + Gemini)
Our solution uses Genkit's powerful flow system to orchestrate multiple AI capabilities:

**Core AI Features:**
- **Classification Model**: Uses Gemini to categorize tickets into 5 categories (Shipping, Returns, Product Info, Technical, Billing)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects customer emotion (Angry, Frustrated, Confused, Neutral, Happy)
- **Priority Scoring**: Combines urgency keywords + sentiment to assign High/Medium/Low priority
- **Response Generation**: Creates contextual, professional response drafts using customer ticket content

**Technology Stack:**
- Firebase Genkit for AI orchestration
- Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for fast inference
- Node.js backend with Express
- React frontend for demo interface

### What Makes It Unique
1. **Multi-Signal Intelligence**: Combines category, sentiment, and urgency for smarter routing
2. **Context-Aware Responses**: Generated responses reference specific customer concerns
3. **Production-Ready**: Includes error handling, rate limiting, and scalable architecture
4. **Business ROI Focus**: Reduces average response time from hours to seconds
